# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py

### Setup
Once you had RIOT API KEY and BOT Token, create a file ".env" in the same directory as the bot and paste the following:

```bash
RIOT_API_KEY="<Your RIOT KEY>"
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="<Your Discord Bot Token>"
```

> **!IMPORTANT!** You should never use your token or key in the code, as it can be easily stolen.


### Running

To run, while in directory - simply type:

```python
python lol-game-spy.py
```

### Adding bot to your server

Once you have your bot running, you can add it to your server by going to the link generated by discord developer portal.

> **!IMPORTANT!** You need to add below permissions for your bot to works.

Others can use the same link to add your bot to their servers.

### Usage

Once you have your bot running and added to your server, you can use the following commands:

```bash
!lgs-help #Displays help message (commands available) 
!lgs-set_channel <channel_id> #Sets channel for bot to post messages in
!lgs-add_player <player_name> <region>  #Adds player to the list
!lgs-remove_player <player_name>  #Removes player from the list
!lgs-list_players #Displays list of tracked players
```
> Keep in mind that bot will start sending messages only if the channel is set and there are players in the list.
